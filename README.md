# Tinybnb

Pretty simple Airbnb-like app built with Angular. Tiny because so am I ✨

This is my first project using Angular. My main goal is to get familiar with the framework by building something cool (well, kinda).

## 💥 Tech Stack

- [Angular](https://angular.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Sass (SCSS)](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) for testing

## 🙇‍♀️ Other resources

- [Tabler icons](https://tabler.io/icons)
- [v0](https://v0.dev/) for design inspiration
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) as code editor

> Why and how am I using Cursor?

This is the first time I try out Cursor as a code editor, after using VS Code exclusively for many years. I genuinely think AI is **_just another tool_**, not a replacement for my knowledge or problem-solving skills.

Since this is my first Angular project, I've mainly used Cursor's agent to ask questions and get feedback to deepen my learning, as well as to handle very repetitive tasks. I have found it more useful than just using ** _insert your AI tool of choice_ ** because it has access to the whole project as context.

## 👩‍💻 Getting Started

To get started, first clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sayheylaura/tinybnb.git
cd tinybnb
```

To run the app locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.

## 🥷 Available Scripts

| Script      | Description                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| pnpm start  | Runs the app in development mode at `localhost:4200` |
| pnpm build  | Builds the app for production to the `dist/` folder  |
| pnpm test   | Runs unit tests using Jasmine and Karma              |
| pnpm lint   | Lints the codebase using ESLint                      |
| pnpm format | Formats the codebase using Prettier                  |

## 🗺️ Roadmap

There are still many things I didn't have time to implement, even if I know they're important. Mainly:

- [x] Form validation
- [ ] Loading and emtpy states
- [ ] Error handling

Apart from that, one of my next career goals is learning backend development to become a fullstack engineer, so at some point:

- [ ] Implement backend: set up a database and an API endpoint to serve property data
